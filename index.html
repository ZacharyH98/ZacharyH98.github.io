	<p>Hello my name is Zachary Hopkins and I am looking to become a programmer I want to do this because I like to solve problems and work them out either it's with others or by myself and fixing something after hard work is really satisfying for me and gives me a sense of accomplishment.
<br >I love to create a project that I can use my logical mind to solve problems and break them down to one task at ones and when I'm finished have something on my screen that I can show for it. </p>
