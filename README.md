This is a template profile page I used and edited to make my own I did this because with the template I have all the creative side of the profile already done for me and all I had to do is edit what I needed and add what I believe I needed to make the profile my own for example the link boxes I changed what they link to and edited out all the junk I didn't need in there. 

Is there room to improve?
i definatly believe there is if i would do this again i would add a little more style with javascript as i like to have more user interaction on a website than having a static one.
